# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
The `return` statement would achieve the same functionality. `return also causes the loop to be abandoned.

A quick point of clarification: 
- A return statement will end the loop **and** the function however break only exits the loop! 
In this example, we do not want to terminate the function but rather come up with a more efficient way of running the loop!
